# scGate_models
Cell type gating models for scGate

Note: we will tag versions of this DB using the format 'vN.M' (e.g. v1.4). This format is understood by scGate to download specific versions of the DB

We are doing test over this database with [BiocFileCache](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BiocFileCache.html) as the solution to scGate data management for Bioconductor trasformation.
